# Cells-Competition
The data and code in this repository should allow full reproduction of the data and figures discussed in the publication.

All results can be reproduced by executing the various Jupyter Python notebooks files in this order:

1.Folder 'Two cell types are independent with common goods (with/without glucose competition)'

In this folder, we could find the code to produce the results for two cell types being independent with common goods in both with and without glucose competition
(e.g., Supplementary Fig S1-S3 and Supplementary table 1 and 2).

2.Folder 'Two cell types are dependent with common goods from each other (glucose competition)'

In this folder, we could find the code to produce the results that two cell types are independent with common goods with glucose competition (e.g., Supplementary Fig S5-S6, S8 and 
Supplementary table 3 and 4).

3.Folder 'Two cell types considering the cell growth'

In this folder, we could find the code to produce the results for all cases of two cell types system (e.g., Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 in main text; Supplementary Fig S9-S12, S14-S15, S17, 
S27, S29 and S30).

4.Folder 'Three cell types considering the cell growth'

In this folder, we could find the code to produce the results for all cases of three cell types system (e.g., Fig. 5-9 in main text; Supplementary Fig S18-S24 and S28).

5. Kinetic results (from Copasi model)

The kinetic data and result are from Copasi model (Supplementary Fig S13 and S16; Supplementary table 25 and 26)
